# Order Component Solution with Angular and SCSS styling

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj), and also my first time using [Angular](https://angular.io/).


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Solution

Live site is [here](https://fobya7.github.io/order-summary-component/).

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Desktop</th>
        <th>Mobile</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="70%"> <img src="readme/screenshot-desktop.png"> </td>
        <td width="30%"> <img src="readme/screenshot-mobile.png"> </td>
    </tr>
</table>


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)

### What I learned

- Well, Angular. Using Angular CLI for starting the project and adding modules.
Angular app structure. A little bit of TypeScript (component classes and imports).

- Some SCSS, namely: variables and imports, using the parent selector.

- Also, how SCSS and Angular interact. In particular, [setting up the style preprocessor](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/using-sass-with-the-angular-cli) to preload my variables from multiple files in a SCSS dedicated dir.

- How to [publish an Angular website on Github Pages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages).

- [Loading fonts remotly](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started).

### Continued development

- I need to get better with organizing code; as in - what goes where, what should be it's own component, how to structure scss files.

- Angular. Using interpolation and routing and so much more things I don't yet know about.

- Typescript. Angular component and module classes seemed interesting, can't wait to do some serious coding.

- SCSS. Will probably start with learning mixins and interpolation.
